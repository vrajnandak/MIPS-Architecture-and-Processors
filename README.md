# MIPS-architecture
The repository contains the implementation of sorting algorithm in assembly language which is used by the self-written C++ assembler to be executed. The results of the execution of the sorting algorithm by the self-written assembler and the results of the same assembly program in MARS simulator are compared.

# Processors_in_cpp
This repository contains the code to implement a pipeline and a non-pipeline processor in C++. A detailed description of the repository is present in the 'report.pdf' file.
